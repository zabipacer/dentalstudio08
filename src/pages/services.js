        <h2>Understanding Dental Crowns</h2>
        <p>A dental crown is a tooth-shaped cap that completely covers a damaged tooth above the gum line. Crowns restore the tooth's shape, size, strength, and appearance while providing long-lasting protection.</p>
        <p>Situations requiring crowns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Large cavities that compromise tooth structure</li>
          <li>Cracked or broken teeth</li>
          <li>Root canal treated teeth</li>

        <h2>Dental Bridges Overview</h2>
        <p>Dental bridges literally "bridge" the gap created by one or more missing teeth. A bridge consists of crowns on either side of the gap (abutment teeth) with artificial teeth (pontics) filling the space.</p>
        <p>Types of bridges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Traditional Bridge:</strong> Most common type using adjacent teeth as anchors</li>
          <li><strong>Cantilever Bridge:</strong> Supported by teeth on one side only</li>
          <li><strong>Maryland Bridge:</strong> Conservative option bonded to back of adjacent teeth</li>
          <li><strong>Implant-Supported Bridge:</strong> Anchored to dental implants rather than natural teeth</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Wisdom Teeth</h2>
        <p>Wisdom teeth, or third molars, are the last teeth to emerge, typically appearing between ages 17-25. While some people have no problems with their wisdom teeth, many require extraction due to insufficient space in the jaw.</p>
        <p>Common reasons for wisdom tooth extraction:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impaction due to insufficient space</li>
          <li>Crowding of existing teeth</li>
          <li>Difficulty cleaning leading to decay or gum disease</li>
          <li>Cysts or tumors around impacted teeth</li>
          <li>Damage to adjacent teeth</li>
          <li>Sinus problems from upper wisdom teeth</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Types of Wisdom Tooth Impaction</h2>
        <h3>Soft Tissue Impaction</h3>
        <p>Tooth has emerged through bone but not through gums completely</p>
        <h3>Partial Bony Impaction</h3>
        <p>Tooth is partially trapped in jawbone</p>
        <h3>Complete Bony Impaction</h3>
        <p>Tooth is completely encased in jawbone</p>
        <h3>Angular Impaction</h3>
        <p>Tooth is angled toward or away from adjacent teeth</p>

      <h2>Understanding TMJ Disorders</h2>
      <p>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders affect the joint connecting your jaw to your skull and the surrounding muscles. These conditions can cause significant pain and interfere with basic functions like eating, speaking, and sleeping.</p>
      <p>Common TMJ symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jaw pain and tenderness</li>
        <li>Clicking, popping, or grinding sounds</li>
        <li>Difficulty opening or closing mouth</li>
        <li>Locking of the jaw joint</li>
        <li>Headaches and earaches</li>
        <li>Facial pain and muscle spasms</li>
        <li>Changes in bite alignment</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Causes of TMJ Disorders</h2>
